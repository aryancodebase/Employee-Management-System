# Employee Task Management Dashboard

A simple **React-based Employee Task Management Dashboard** that allows employees and administrators to log in and manage tasks. The application demonstrates **role-based dashboards, authentication, task management, and global state management using React Context API**.

This project simulates a **real-world task management system** where employees can view their assigned tasks and administrators can manage the system.

# 🚀 Features

### 🔐 Authentication System

* Login system for both **Admin** and **Employees**
* Authentication handled using **React Context API**
* Logged-in user information stored in **Local Storage**
* Session persistence even after page refresh

### 👨‍💼 Role-Based Dashboards

* **Admin Dashboard**

  * Access system-level controls
  * Manage employees and tasks (future enhancement)

* **Employee Dashboard**

  * View assigned tasks
  * Track task status
  * See task details including category and deadline

### 📋 Task Management

Each employee has a list of tasks containing:

* Task title
* Description
* Category
* Deadline date
* Task status (Active / Completed)

### 🔄 Dynamic Task Rendering

Tasks are dynamically displayed using:

* `React.map()` to loop through task lists
* Task cards generated automatically based on user data

### 🌐 Global State Management

* Implemented using **React Context API**
* Allows access to logged-in user data across components

### 💾 Persistent Login

User login information is saved in:

```
localStorage
```

This allows the application to remember the logged-in user even after refreshing the page.

## Admin

```
Email: admin@me.com
Password: 123
```

Capabilities:

* Access Admin Dashboard

# 📊 Task Object Structure

Each employee contains a list of tasks structured as:

```javascript
{
  id: 1,
  title: "Fix login bug",
  description: "Resolve issue where users cannot login with valid credentials.",
  date: "2026-03-01",
  category: "Development",
  status: "active"
}
```

---

# 🔑 Authentication Flow

1. User enters **email and password**
2. System searches the `users` array
3. If credentials match:

   * User data is stored in **React Context**
   * User data is stored in **Local Storage**
4. Based on the **user role**, the appropriate dashboard is rendered

```
Admin → Admin Dashboard
Employee → Employee Dashboard
```

# 📌 Key Concepts Demonstrated

This project demonstrates several important React concepts:

### React Hooks

* `useState`
* `useEffect`
* `useContext`

### Context API

Used to share authenticated user information globally.

### Optional Chaining

Used to safely access nested properties:

```
user?.tasks?.map()
```

### Dynamic Rendering

Tasks are rendered dynamically from user data.
